  <h3><i><b>What is Fungus???</b></i></h3>
<p>Firstly we have to understand,what is fungus?These are organisms separate from the plants and animal kingdoms. They are ubiquitous in nature and are found in the soil, plants, decaying organic matter, water, air, damp places, and also in humans and animals. They play a very important role in our ecosystem along with bacteria, by degrading organic matter into simpler forms for the consumption of plants. “They include the household yeast, molds, mushrooms, and several others. There are about 1,44,000 species of fungi (plural for fungus), out of which some of them are pathogenic to humans. The most common being Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Pneumocystis, and Mucormycetes,” he explained.</p>
